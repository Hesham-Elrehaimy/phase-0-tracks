# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is used to keep track of revisions made to files and to merge these revision into one file. It is useful because it allows us to view every step and look for any errors that were made. It also allows more than one person to work on a project.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a copy of the repository that could be edited without affecting the original repository. A branch is useful because it allows us to edit a file or have someone else edit a file without changing anything in the original file before merging.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
commit creates a save point on the coding timeline that we could revisit later. A good commit message has to clearly state changes made and be easily understood when read later.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict happens when two or more different changes have been made to the same part of a file and the branches were merged with the master branch. When this happens git doesn't know which change to use and marks the part as a conflict.
